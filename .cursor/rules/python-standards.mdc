# Python Style & Formatting

## PEP 8 and Formatting

- Follow PEP 8
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Line length: 120 characters
- Use a formatter (e.g. black, ruff) for consistency

## Import Order

1. Standard library
2. Third-party packages
3. Local application / project modules

Use a single blank line between each group.

## Docstrings

- Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Include Args, Returns, and Raises where relevant

```python
def latency_encoding(self, latency: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Encode latency budget into embedding space.

    Args:
        latency: Per-sample latency budget, shape [batch_size].

    Returns:
        Latency embeddings, shape [batch_size, hidden_size].
    """
```
